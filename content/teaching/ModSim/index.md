[Weeky material of the course](https://github.com/GabrielEGC/UTEC_Courses/tree/main/ModSim_week)

In this theoretical course, we will introduce the fundamentals of the modeling and simulation process for dynamic systems. This will allow students to understand that a dynamic system can be represented by a mathematical model that characterizes its real-life behavior and can be solved using computational solution tools. Thus, the consolidation of this knowledge will allow students to analyze the behavior of dynamic systems with the goal of developing solutions to engineering problems. This course will develop simulation skills using MATLAB and Simulink with the goal of being able to interpret the results obtained from the system using different input signals.

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to model four types of linear dynamic systems (mechanical, electrical, thermal, and level), understanding their behavior through the solution of differential equations and their subsequent simulation; understand the behavior of four first- and second-order physical systems through their temporal and frequency behavior; Correct the behavior of the 4 dynamic systems studied to achieve temporal behavior in accordance with the design requirements. This will be achieved through the implementation of control algorithms.
