[Weeky material of the course](https://github.com/GabrielEGC/UTEC_Courses/tree/main/IntelligentC_week)

The intelligent control course is inspired by biological systems and the way they learn to solve problems. In some cases, the objective of intelligent control is to replace a human performing a control task. Initially, the course provides an introduction to fuzzy logic and fuzzy controllers. It then presents some applications of fuzzy control in plants whose model is unknown or too complex to be controlled with other conventional techniques. All the strategies studied are used to model and control systems whose dynamics are too complicated for traditional analytical methods. Finally, this course addresses techniques based on machine learning, with special emphasis on artificial neural networks. An introduction to other methods such as reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms will also be provided. All these techniques will be applied to engineering problems related to data modeling and control.
