[Weeky material of the course](https://github.com/GabrielEGC/UTEC_Courses/tree/main/NonlinearC_week)

This course, of a theoretical and practical nature, deals with the analysis and control of nonlinear, time-varying, and time-invariant systems. The importance for this study lies in the fact that most real systems are nonlinear. In this sense, it is necessary to understand the phenomena that interact in these types of systems in order to adequately control them. Nonlinear systems are significantly different from linear systems, which implies that in many cases it is not enough to simply convert nonlinear systems into linear systems. In this course, we will investigate how nonlinear systems can be analyzed and controlled. In particular, we will discuss various notions of stability and develop a general theory for establishing stability properties for nonlinear systems. Additionally, nonlinear control methods will be developed and applied to different examples of mechanical systems, robotics, avionics, etc., including linearizations of classical methods.
