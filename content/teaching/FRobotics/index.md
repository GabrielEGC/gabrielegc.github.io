[Weeky material of the course](https://github.com/GabrielEGC/UTEC_Courses/tree/main/FRobotics_week)

This theoretical and practical course introduces fundamental robotics concepts from a mechanical and analytical perspective. The course seeks to understand, analyze, and determine the kinematic and dynamic model of robot manipulators, in order to control their motion to achieve desired positions and orientations through joint commands of position, velocity, or torque sent to the robot's actuators. The course emphasizes robot manipulators, but also presents the modeling and control principles for wheeled and aerial mobile robots. The main topics covered in this course are: spatial representations of rigid bodies, kinematics of robot manipulators, dynamics of robot manipulators, and an introduction to motion control.
