[Weeky material of the course](https://github.com/GabrielEGC/UTEC_Courses/tree/main/ProcessC_week)

This theoretical and practical course is designed for students of Electronic and Mechatronic Engineering and other related engineering programs to deepen their knowledge of the main concepts related to the design and implementation of automatic control systems (Single Input Single Output) and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output), using advanced control techniques. The course emphasizes bridging the gap between theory and industrial practice. The main topics covered in this course are: discrete systems; process identification; design and implementation of control strategies: ratio, cascade, split range, selective, and feedforward; PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) MIMO control; LQR/LQG (Linear Quadratic Regulator/Linear Quadratic Gaussian) SISO and MIMO control for continuous and discrete processes; MBPC (Model Base Predictive Control) control and LQR predictive SISO and MIMO control; fractional order SISO and MIMO control; SISO and MIMO control of processes with dead time; robust SISO IMC (Internal Model Control).
